# Ethernet Local Area Networks

In modern environments you will find that, at a general level, computer data networks can be categorized in two types: 

* Local Area Networks - connecting nearby devices, in the same room, building or campus of buildings
* Wide Area Networks - devices are somewhat geographically separated

The aggregate use of these two types of networks covers most of the communication requirements of modern businesses, they  deliver data from one endpoint to another. 

## The Ethernet or Wired LAN

Ethernet is a general reference to any cable that conforms to any of several Ethernet Standards. However, the cables used for the links use copper wires more often than not. 

In contrast to the Wired LAN, the Wireless LAN or WLAN uses radio-frequencies to transmit data between nodes instead of wires for the links. 

[The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \(IEEE\)](https://www.ieee.org/) define the required elements to build an Ethernet-based Local Area Network. These elements, among others include: 

### Devices

Assuming an Ethernet-only Local Area Network we would need an Ethernet LAN _switch,_ the switch's purpose is to increase the amount of ports that can be used to connect wires terminating into the client machines - this concept is also known as _port density_. These client machines are connected via their network interface card's Ethernet port using an Ethernet cable. 

### Cabling

### Connector Terminals or Interfaces

### Protocol Rules
