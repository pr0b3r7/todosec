# Types of Networks

## Ethernet LAN Standards

Ethernet is a general reference to any cable that conforms to any of several Ethernet Standards.

Define layer 1 and layer 2 \(physical and data-link\) of wired Local Area Network Technology. 

[The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \(IEEE\)](https://www.ieee.org/) define the required elements to build an Ethernet-based Local Area Network. These elements, among others include: 

### Devices

Assuming an Ethernet-only Local Area Network we would need an Ethernet LAN _switch,_ the switch's purpose is to increase the amount of ports that can be used to connect wires terminating into the client machines. These client machines are connected via their network interface card's Ethernet port using an Ethernet cable. 

### Cabling

### Connector Terminals or Interfaces

### Protocol Rules
