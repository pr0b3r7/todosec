# Domain Name System

**When you browse to https://startpage.com**

Initially, a DNS request is made. DNS is like a giant phone book that takes a URL \(Like https://startpage.com/\) and turns it into an IP address. This means that people donâ€™t have to remember IP addresses for their favourite websites.

The IP address uniquely identifies each internet connected device, like a web server or your computer. These are formed of 4 groups of numbers, each 0-255 \(x.x.x.x\) and called an octet. An example shown below is 100.70.172.11.
