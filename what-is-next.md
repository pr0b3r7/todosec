DNS amplification \(how to manipulate recursive DNS to DoS the target.\); Use of a botnet, possible DNS attacks with it.
* N-tier architecture - multilayer architecture; distributing roles across several different servers, each tier consisting of a role mapped to one of more \(in the case of clusters\) of machines. Oftentimes 3 layers are employed: Presentation, Logic and Data tiers as a common implementation but not the only one.

What is the downside? \(Data gets added to the URL\); Does POST do this? 
* Directory Traversal, common on older machines \(unauthorized access of restricted directories and execution of commands in directories other than the web-server's; ../ attack or non-validated input attack.; Unicode, what is it? use cases and risks, relationship between HTTP GET and non-validated input - command execution, brute-force of administrative access passwds, etc.; URL Tampering/unauthorized manipulation of parameters within the URL, the goal is to modify settings and achieve escalation of privileges, credentials and potentially business data; Password and SSH brute-forcing; Web defacing/vandalism - unauthorized

  changing appearances of websites

* Use of Metasploit; pre-loaded with Telnet, SSH, and HTTP modules to automatically take advantage of previously published CVEs, perform passwd attacks as well as configure custom payloads; create custom modules \(\), plug-ins and interfaces \(Armitage\); Additionally, Post-exploitation tools such as **multi/handler** are specially useful. 
* Web 1.0 vs Web 2.0 differences - static vs dynamic web page content. \(Better suited for social media\) - Since there are more capabilities built in the websites, more attack surface is also a downside of this evolution. 
* Web Application attacks include: arbitrary command execution via injecting them into the input string, this is possible due to poor input validation in the application; Methods include _file injection \(_attacker injects a pointer in form input to an exploit hosted elsewhere_\)_, _command injection \(_attacker injects commands into the form fields instead of expected test entry_\), shell injection \(_attacker attempts to gain shell access by executing OS commands on the server running the web-app_\)._
* SOAP injection - Simple Object Access Protocol \(SOAP\) - Goal is to exchange structured information in web services, uses XML as formatting to present the information. Injection of malicious query strings \(Similar to SQL injection\) - allows authentication bypass and database access in the back-end, compatibility with HTTP and SMTP are usually 1-way. 
* Stack smashing, Buffer Overflows attack - the goal is to overwrite the application's pre-determined memory buffer area, replace what's supposed to be in there and execute arbitrary code or make an application crash. 
* Cross-site scripting \(XSS\) - the goal is injection of a script in a form field that had a storage purpose. XSS classic attack vector involves access to "document.cookie" and sending it to the remote hosts. 
* Cross-site request forgery \(CSRF\) - attack vector that forces the end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they are authenticated. CSRF makes the target inadvertently submitting a malicious request. 
* Session fixation attacks, similar to CSRF, attacker fetches a "session ID" that is sent in a Phishing email to target, when the victim clicks and logs in to the site, the attacker is now able to use the same "session ID" to log in and use the user's access.
* _Cookies:_ small text file stored on client machine for use by the web server. Contains information such as authentication details, site preferences, shopping cart, in general session details, they can contain _some_ of this data or all. Sent in Header of HTTP response from a web server, may or may not have an expiration date. Goal: provide a stable web view for customers and speed up access for repeated visitors.

SQL injection common and successful injection attack. Structured Query Language \(SQL\) is a language for managing data in relational database systems. RDBS is a collection of tables \(rows, hold individual fields of data\) tied using common key, that can be updated and queried. Tables have a name. It is referenced when you perform queries or updates. SQL comes into play when you are adding, deleting, moving, updating, or viewing the data in those tables and fields.; SQL queries usually begin with SELECT. SELECT chooses the data to perform an action on. In addition to SELECT, several additional options and commands are useful. i.e, **DROP TABLE** _**tablename**_ will delete the table _tablename_ from the database. INSERT and UPDATE are also easy to understand.; SQL injection occurs when attacker injects SQL queries into the input form. SQL command bypasses the front end and executes on the database. To check vulnerability against SQL injection, check your target for a web login page, instead of entering what’s asked for on the web form, simply try a single quote \(**'**\) and see what kind of error message, if any, you receive. If that doesn’t work, try entering _**anything**_**'or 1=1-** and see what you get. The attack names and definitions for SQL are union query, tautology, blind SQL injection, and error-based SQL injection.

Another neat little attack is called HTTP response splitting. The attack works by adding header response data to an input field so the server splits the response in a couple directions. If it works, the attacker controls the content of the second header, which can be used for any number of things—like redirecting the user to a malicious site the attacker runs.

A common method of security testing \(hacking\) a web application is to simply try using it in a manner in which it wasn’t intended to be used.

Countermeasures for web server and application attacks include correct placement of the servers and maintaining a strong patch management effort. Others include turning off unnecessary services, ports, and protocols; removing outdated, unused accounts and properly configuring default accounts that must remain; setting up appropriate file and folder permissions and disabling directory listing as much as possible; and ensuring you have a means to detect attacks and to respond to them.

Sqlmap, Havij, and sqlninja are all automated scanners designed to look specifically for injection vulnerabilities. SQLBrute is a tool that allows you to blast through predefined SQL injection queries against a target. Others tools include Pangolin, SQLExec, Absinthe, and BobCat.
