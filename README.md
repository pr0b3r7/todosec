Hi Team, thank you for visiting. I say _Team_ because we're in this learning journey **together** and, by providing my notes and documenting everything I learn, study and teach on my way to achieve Cisco's CCNP Encor 350-401 and eCPPTv2 , I hope others pursuing the same \(i.e [Reddit eLS](https://www.reddit.com/r/eLearnSecurity/) or [Reddit CCNP](https://www.reddit.com/r/ccnp/)\) to find this information useful. 

For the remainder of 2020, I will be working on my CCNP Enterprise Core 350-401 exam, after which I will prepare for the eCPPTv2 as a "warm-up" of sorts before starting the PWK and study for OSCP as it is still an HR gatekeeper after all. 

For 2021, I hope to prepare for CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure and conquer the OSCP!

I want to help you the way others more experienced and knowledgeable than me have helped and guided me too. Please count on me, we're in this **together**!
