### Blackbox Testing - Opaque

Implies there is no internal knowledge of the components and its aim is to simulate the adversaries that would be attacking our system from outside. 

Tester is not given network topologies, security architecture insider information nor credentials to access. 

Requires the highest level of skill on part of the attacker as they must find their way through the security controls. 

Downside is that assessment of internal controls largely depends on the attackers ability to circumvent defenses. 

### Gray Testing 

This type of testing relies on potential escalation of privileges avenues on a system. Attacker starts from the perspective of a user with operator level access on the system. 

Provides a more efficient approach to security testing since the attacker might focus their efforts in a given direction as more information is available than in a pure Blackbox test.
